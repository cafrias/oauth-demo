# OAuth Demo

This is a demo app I built to practice OAuth.

This includes:

- `auth-server`: A custom build OAuth server that supports:
    - Authorization Code
    - Authorization Code with PCKE
- `resource-server`: A resource server that serves a simple API
- `mobile-app`: A mobile app that uses the OAuth server to authenticate and access the resource server
- `web-app`: A web app that uses the OAuth server to authenticate and access the resource server
